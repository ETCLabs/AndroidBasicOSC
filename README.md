AndroidBasicOSC
A simple Android project that can send and receive OSC messages.

About this ETCLabs Project
AndroidBasicOSC is open-source software (developed by a combination of end users and ETC employees in their free time) designed to be expanded upon to add more OSC functionality. On the OSC Sender page currently there is a buttons card and custom card, but it can be expanded to add any kind of OSC message type that is needed. The OSC Receiver page logs the date/time a message was received and what the message was. Finally, there is a settings page to allow for input of the IP Address and in/out ports. This is not official ETC software. For challenges using, integrating, compiling, or modifying this software, we encourage posting on the Issues page of this project. ETC Support is not familiar with this software and will not be able to assist if issues arise. (Hopefully issues won't happen, and you'll have a lot of fun with these tools and toys!)
We also welcome pull requests for bug fixes and feature additions.
